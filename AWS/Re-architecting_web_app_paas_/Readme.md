About Project
- Previous project we have seen deployed vprofile application stack on aws cloud.
- multi tier web application stack (vprofile)
- Re-architect / Re-factor services for aws cloud (strategy = refactoring)
- Architecture to boost agility or improve business continuity 

#### Scenario
- Project services are running on physical / virtual / cloud machines it cloud be even EC2 instances.
- Dealing with varieties of services that powers your project runtime
	- DB, Application server (tomcat), web server, network service etc..
- To manage these need multiple teams
	- cloud computing team
	-  virtualization team
	- Data-centre operation team
	- Monitoring Team (24/7)
	- system admin team etc..


#### Problems
- Operational overhead
- struggling with uptime  & scaling
- UpFront CapEx & OpEX (if you are using your own local data-centre)
- manual process / difficult to automate
- Time consuming & expensive.


#### Solution
- we can really use cloud platform but instead of using IAAC (Infrastructure As A code) we will be using PAAS & SAAS
	- PAAS -> Platform As A Service.
	- SAAS -> Software As A Service.
- If we talking about AWS , will not going with regular EC2 instances, but we using some cloud manage services.
- Cloud means we can code our infrastructure so we have IAAS.
- PAAS & SAAS very flexible & Elastic in nature
- Scaling will be taken care by the cloud vendor .
- Pay as go
- Lots of lot automation.
- Good performance
- Will not need huge team to manage this.
